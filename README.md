# RCLONE MANAGER

Small dependency-free web app for creating and managing persistent `rclone mount`
definitions and `rclone` remotes.

One repo, two platform modes:

- `linux` mode: for normal Linux distros with `systemd`
- `unraid` mode: for Unraid hosts, using persistent files and boot scripts instead of `systemd`

What it does:

- imports existing persistent mounts
- imports existing `rclone` remotes from `rclone.conf`
- creates and edits mount definitions
- creates and edits remote endpoints such as HTTP `url=` targets
- starts, stops, restarts, and deletes mounts
- restarts affected mounts after remote changes

Default port: `5573`

## Install

Clone the repo, then from the repo root run:

```bash
sudo bash install.sh
```

The installer auto-detects the platform:

- on normal Linux, it runs `install-linux.sh`
- on Unraid, it runs `install-unraid.sh`

To set your own login:

```bash
sudo RCLONE_MANAGER_USER=admin RCLONE_MANAGER_PASS='strong-password' bash install.sh
```

## Linux mode

- installs to `/opt/rclone-mount-manager`
- creates `/etc/default/rclone-mount-manager`
- creates `rclone-mount-manager.service`
- manages mounts as `systemd` units

## Unraid mode

- installs to `/boot/config/plugins/rclone-mount-manager`
- stores mount definitions, pid files, and logs in that same persistent area
- updates `/boot/config/go` to start the web app on boot
- waits for `/mnt/user` before auto-starting saved mounts
- manages mounts directly as `rclone mount` processes instead of `systemd`

Unraid notes:

- `systemd` is not used
- host FUSE support is still required for `rclone mount`
- if you use `--allow-other`, your FUSE configuration must permit it
- the default Unraid `rclone.conf` path is auto-detected, but you can override it with `RCLONE_CONFIG_FILE`

## Update

Pull the latest changes or replace the repo contents, then rerun `install.sh`.

## Source layout

- [app.py](./app.py): shared web app with Linux and Unraid backends
- [install.sh](./install.sh): auto-detecting installer
- [install-linux.sh](./install-linux.sh): standard Linux install
- [install-unraid.sh](./install-unraid.sh): Unraid-specific install
